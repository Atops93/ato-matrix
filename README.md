This is my heavist site of them all.
(Not all website files are uploaded of course because github has a file limit size, I host the site locally with cloudflare tunnels.)

Ermm BUT ATOPS, I THOUGHT YOU HATE HEAVY SITES????: I still have my other light ass sites running, this was just cool I thought.

Thanks to [Shreshth](https://github.com/ShreshthTiwari) for the help!
